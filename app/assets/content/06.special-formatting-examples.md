## Special cases

### Underlined

Goal: `__Underlined text__` should become `<u>Underlined text</u>`

Solved with a custom plugin (TODO)

### Language attribute

Goal: rendering certain words as `span` with elements should become `<span lang="xx">word</span>`

Can be accomplished with Nuxt MDC Attrbute syntax:

Test :

```md
[Word]{lang="xx" title="This is a title"}
```

Output: [Word]{lang="en" title="This is a title"}

### Internal links localizing

Goal: `[link](/posts/test-markdown-text)` should become `<a href="/en-us/posts/test-markdown-text">link</a>`

Can be accomplished by:

- Modifying the default ProseA component (which Nuxt MDC will replace the regular HTML `<a>` tag with a NUxtLink that adds the locale to internal links)

Test:

```md
[link](/posts/test-markdown-text)
```

Output: [link](/posts/test-markdown-text)

### Nested lists

Goal: Nested lists should be rendered correctly

This is already handled by Nuxt MDC

```md
- List item 1
  - Sublist item 1 (add two spaces before the dash to indent on the previous line)
  - Sublist item 2
    - Sub subitem
```
